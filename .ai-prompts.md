# Option to not search about the target enterprise 

The user generally knows the target enterprise.
But when the job advertisement is made by a headhunter, the user may not know the target enterprise.
Therefore, the user should be able to choose if he wants to search about the target enterprise or not.

This is currently partially implemented in the code.
I want to add more user friendly option: when the user selects the option not to search about the target enterprise in the user interface, the input field for the target enterprise should be disabled so that the user cannot enter anything in it.

But if the user selects the option to search about the target enterprise, the input field for the target enterprise should be enabled and the user interface must remind the user that he must enter the target enterprise.

Propose me the changes to make to the user interface in order to achieve all that.

# Make the application display an error message if a required environment variable is not set 

I want to implement the feature that if an environment variable required by the backend is not set, the application should display an error message in a red box at the top of the home page.

Tell me the modifications to make to the code in order to achieve that.


# "Missing required fields for CV" and "Missing required fields for Cover Letter" when "Attempt to use specific information about the company" is unchecked

When the user unchecks the "Attempt to use specific information about the company" checkbox, 
then submit the form, the application displays a message saying "Missing required fields for CV" 
and "Missing required fields for Cover Letter".

This is not the expected behavior.

The expected behavior is that the application should process the form and generate the CV and Cover Letter without paying attention to the target enterprise.

It must only care about the enterprise name when the user checks the "Attempt to use specific information about the company" checkbox.

Tell me the modifications to make to the code in order to achieve that.
