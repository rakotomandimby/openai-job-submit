# The CV redering has too much interline spacing

The cover letter rendering in the application is Good.

But the CV rendering has too much interline spacing. 
After checking the HTML fragment returned by the API, I found that the code is good, without extra new lines.

I suspect that the problem is somewhere in the code where the code applies a non visible blank line for each line in the HTML fragment.
Analyzing the code and tell me if I am in the right direction.
