# Scan for potential critical data leaks in the codebase

I want you to scan the codebase for potential critical data leaks. Look for any instances where sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, or personal data might be exposed. This could include hardcoded secrets, logging sensitive information, or any other practices that could lead to data leaks. Provide a summary of your findings and suggest best practices to avoid these issues in the future.
