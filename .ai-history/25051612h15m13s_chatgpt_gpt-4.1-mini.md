# Make number of words for cover letter predefined 

The current code lets the user define the number of words for the cover letter.
But this has no sense to let the user make a free choice.

I want to define a fixed choice of 3 options: 100, 200, 300 words.

Tell me the modifications make to `index.ejs` to implement that.

To replace the free number input for the cover letter word count with a fixed choice of 3 options (100, 200, 300 words), you should change the `<input type="number">` to a `<select>` dropdown with those options.

Here is the modified part of your `index.ejs` form for the "Number of words (for Cover Letter)" field:

```html
<div class="mb-3">
  <label for="words-number" class="form-label">Number of words (for Cover Letter)</label>
  <select class="form-select" id="words-number" name="words" aria-label="Select number of words for cover letter">
    <option value="100" selected>100 words</option>
    <option value="200">200 words</option>
    <option value="300">300 words</option>
  </select>
</div>
```

### Summary of changes:
- Replace the `<input type="number" ...>` with a `<select>` element.
- Provide three `<option>` elements with values 100, 200, and 300.
- Set the default selected option to 100 (matching your current default).

This will restrict the user to only select one of the three predefined word counts. The rest of your backend code can remain unchanged since it reads the `words` value from the form submission as a string.
