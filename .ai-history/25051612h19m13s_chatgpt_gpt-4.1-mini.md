# Make number of words for cover letter predefined 

The current code lets the user define the number of words for the cover letter.
But this has no sense to let the user make a free choice.

I want to define a fixed choice of 3 options: 100, 200, 300 words.
I want 3 radio buttons for that.
They must be displayed inline, side by side, with a border in order to ease the choice.

Tell me the modifications make to `index.ejs` to implement that, and if there are any modifications to be made to other files, tell me which ones and what to do.

To replace the free number input for cover letter words with 3 fixed radio button options (100, 200, 300 words) displayed inline with a border, do the following:

---

### 1. Modify `views/index.ejs`

Replace the current number input for words with a group of 3 inline radio buttons styled with Bootstrap and a border container.

Find this part in your form:

```html
<div class="mb-3">
  <label for="words-number" class="form-label">Number of words (for Cover Letter)</label>
  <input type="number" class="form-control" id="words-number" placeholder="Enter number of words for cover letter" name="words" value="100">
</div>
```

Replace it with:

```html
<div class="mb-3">
  <label class="form-label d-block">Number of words (for Cover Letter)</label>
  <div class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Number of words for cover letter" style="border: 1px solid #ced4da; border-radius: 0.375rem; padding: 0.25rem;">
    <input type="radio" class="btn-check" name="words" id="words100" value="100" autocomplete="off" checked>
    <label class="btn btn-outline-primary mb-0" for="words100">100</label>

    <input type="radio" class="btn-check" name="words" id="words200" value="200" autocomplete="off">
    <label class="btn btn-outline-primary mb-0" for="words200">200</label>

    <input type="radio" class="btn-check" name="words" id="words300" value="300" autocomplete="off">
    <label class="btn btn-outline-primary mb-0" for="words300">300</label>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Explanation:**

- Using Bootstrap's `btn-group` and `btn-check` classes to create toggleable radio buttons styled as buttons.
- Added a border and padding around the group for clarity.
- The first option (100) is checked by default.
- Labels act as clickable buttons.

---

### 2. No changes needed in `index.ts`

Your backend already expects `words` as a string from the form and uses it directly. Since the radio buttons send the value as a string ("100", "200", or "300"), no change is needed in the server code.

---

### 3. No changes needed in other files

The prompt generation and system instructions already accept `words` as a string, so no modification is required.

---

### Summary

- Only modify the form input for `words` in `index.ejs` as above.
- No other code changes are necessary.

If you want, I can provide the full updated snippet of the form part or the entire `index.ejs`.
