# "Missing required fields for CV" and "Missing required fields for Cover Letter" when "Attempt to use specific information about the company" is unchecked

When the user unchecks the "Attempt to use specific information about the company" checkbox, 
then submit the form, the application displays a message saying "Missing required fields for CV" 
and "Missing required fields for Cover Letter".

This is not the expected behavior.

The expected behavior is that the application should process the form and generate the CV and Cover Letter without paying attention to the target enterprise.

It must only care about the enterprise name when the user checks the "Attempt to use specific information about the company" checkbox.

Tell me the modifications to make to the code in order to achieve that.
