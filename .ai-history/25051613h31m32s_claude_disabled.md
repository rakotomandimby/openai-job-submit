# Add CSRF protection to the form

I want to add CSRF protection to the form. This will prevent CSRF attacks by ensuring that the form is submitted from the same origin as the server. The CSRF token should be included in the form as a hidden input field. The server should validate the token when processing the form submission.
Tell me the modifications to make to the code to add CSRF protection to the form.
