# Langage choice styling

I have set a particular style, with a border for the "number of word" checkbox of the cover letter.
I want you to align the langage choice with the same style. 

But I also want you to add a flag image for each language using https://github.com/lipis/flag-icons.
Its usage can be made by CdN:
```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/lipis/flag-icons@7.2.3/css/flag-icons.min.css"
/>
```

Then
```html
<span class="fi fi-fr"></span>
```

Tell me the modification to make to the code in order to have the same styling and have the flag image.
