# The CV redering has too much interline spacing

The cover letter rendering in the application is Good.

But the CV rendering has too much interline spacing. 
After checking the HTML fragment returned by the API, I found that the code is good, without extra new lines.

I suspect that the problem is somewhere in the code where the code applies a non visible blank line for each line in the HTML fragment.
Analyzing the code and tell me if I am in the right direction.

# Analysis of CV Rendering Issue with Interline Spacing

After analyzing your code, I believe I've identified the issue with the excessive interline spacing in the CV rendering.

## The Source of the Problem

The key difference between how the cover letter and CV results are processed is in the `nl2br()` function usage:

1. **Cover Letter Processing:**
   - In `getOpenAICoverLetterResult()` and `getGeminiCoverLetterResult()`, the `nl2br()` function is applied to the API response.
   - This function replaces newlines with `<br>` tags.

2. **CV Processing:**
   - In `getOpenAICVResult()` and `getGeminiCVResult()`, the raw text from the API response is returned without applying `nl2br()`.
   - However, the HTML is rendered with `white-space: pre-wrap` in the EJS template.

## The Issue

The `white-space: pre-wrap` CSS property (applied to all result cards in the EJS template) is causing the problem:

```html
<div class="card-body" id="geminiCVResult" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
  <%- geminiCVResult %>
</div>
```

This CSS property preserves all whitespace characters, including newlines. When combined with HTML content that already has its own spacing (like paragraphs, divs, etc.), it creates double spacing:
1. The spacing from the HTML elements themselves
2. The spacing from the preserved newlines in the text

## Solution

Since your CV responses are expected to be HTML fragments, you should NOT use `white-space: pre-wrap` for the CV results. Instead, you should:

1. Update the EJS template to have different styling for CV results vs Cover Letter results:

```typescript
<div class="card-body" id="geminiCVResult">
  <%- geminiCVResult %>
</div>

<!-- For cover letters, keep pre-wrap -->
<div class="card-body" id="geminiCoverLetterResult" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
  <%- geminiCoverLetterResult %>
</div>
```

This will allow the CV's HTML to be rendered normally without the extra preservation of whitespace, while keeping the cover letter formatting intact.

You're definitely on the right track - the issue is specifically with how the rendered HTML is displayed rather than with the content itself.
