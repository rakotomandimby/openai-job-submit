# "Missing required fields for CV" and "Missing required fields for Cover Letter" when "Attempt to use specific information about the company" is unchecked

When the user unchecks the "Attempt to use specific information about the company" checkbox, 
then submit the form, the application displays a message saying "Missing required fields for CV" 
and "Missing required fields for Cover Letter".

This is not the expected behavior.

The expected behavior is that the application should process the form and generate the CV and Cover Letter without paying attention to the target enterprise.

It must only care about the enterprise name when the user checks the "Attempt to use specific information about the company" checkbox.

Tell me the modifications to make to the code in order to achieve that.

Okay, I understand the issue. The problem arises because when the "Attempt to use specific information about the company" checkbox is unchecked, the `company` input field is disabled on the client-side. Disabled input fields are not submitted with the form, meaning `req.body.company` becomes `undefined` on the server. The existing validation logic then incorrectly flags this as a missing required field.

To fix this, we need to adjust the server-side validation in `src/index.ts` to only require the `company` field if `searchCompanyInfo` is true. If `searchCompanyInfo` is false, the `company` field can be absent or 'Unknown', and the application should proceed.

Here's the modified code for `./src/index.ts`:

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
import path from 'path';
import { Request, Response } from 'express';
import { getOpenAICoverLetterResult, getOpenAICVResult } from './ask-openai';
import { getGeminiCoverLetterResult, getGeminiCVResult } from './ask-gemini';
import { getAuthToken } from './utils';

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// --- Environment Variable Checks ---
const envErrors: string[] = [];

if (!process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY) {
  envErrors.push("OPENAI_API_KEY is not set. OpenAI features may not work.");
}
if (!process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY) {
  envErrors.push("GEMINI_API_KEY is not set. Gemini features may not work.");
}

const configuredAuthToken = getAuthToken();
if (!configuredAuthToken) {
  envErrors.push("AUTH_TOKEN is not set or is empty. The application is insecure, and submissions will be blocked.");
}
// --- End Environment Variable Checks ---

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, '../views'));
app.use(express.static('public'));

app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.render('index', {
    envErrors: envErrors,
    geminiCVResult: "Waiting for your job description for CV generation",
    openAICVResult: "Waiting for your job description for CV generation",
    geminiCoverLetterResult: "Waiting for your question for Cover Letter",
    openAICoverLetterResult: "Waiting for your question for Cover Letter"
  });
});

app.post('/', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { job, language, position, words, token: submittedToken } = req.body;
  // req.body.company might be undefined if the input field was disabled client-side
  const companyFromRequest = req.body.company;
  // If searchCompany checkbox is unchecked, req.body.searchCompany will be undefined.
  // So, (undefined === 'true') is false.
  // If checked, req.body.searchCompany will be 'true'.
  // So, ('true' === 'true') is true.
  const searchCompanyInfo = req.body.searchCompany === 'true';

  const baseRenderOptions = {
    envErrors: envErrors,
    geminiCVResult: "An error occurred or input was missing.",
    openAICVResult: "An error occurred or input was missing.",

      openAICoverLetterResult: "Missing required fields: job, language, position, words, or token."
    });
  }

  // Conditionally validate company field: required only if searchCompanyInfo is true
  if (searchCompanyInfo && !companyFromRequest) {
    // If searchCompanyInfo is true, company name is required.
    // The client-side script enables the input, so it should be submitted.
    // If it's still not submitted or empty, it's an error.
    return res.render('index', {

  } else {
    // If not searching for company info, default to 'Unknown'.
    // This handles cases where companyFromRequest is undefined (due to disabled input)
    // or if the user somehow submitted an empty string.
    // The downstream functions (like getSystemInstructionCoverLetter)
    // expect 'Unknown' or an actual company name.
    companyForProcessing = 'Unknown';

**Key changes in `./src/index.ts`:**

1.  **Separated Company Field Handling**:
    *   `const companyFromRequest = req.body.company;` retrieves the company name. This might be `undefined` if the input field was disabled.
    *   `const searchCompanyInfo = req.body.searchCompany === 'true';` correctly determines if company-specific information should be used.

2.  **Revised Validation Logic**:
    *   The first validation block now checks for fields that are *always* required: `job`, `language`, `position`, `words`, and `submittedToken`.
    *   A new, conditional validation block checks for `companyFromRequest` *only if* `searchCompanyInfo` is `true`.

3.  **Determining `companyForProcessing`**:
    *   A variable `companyForProcessing` is introduced.
    *   If `searchCompanyInfo` is `true`, `companyForProcessing` is set to `companyFromRequest` (which, at this point, has been validated to exist).
    *   If `searchCompanyInfo` is `false`, `companyForProcessing` is explicitly set to `'Unknown'`. This ensures that even if `companyFromRequest` was `undefined` (due to the disabled input field), the downstream functions receive a consistent value indicating that company-specific details should not be sought.

4.  **Passing Parameters to AI Services**:
    *   `companyForProcessing` and `searchCompanyInfo` are passed to `getGeminiCoverLetterResult` and `getOpenAICoverLetterResult`. The CV generation functions do not need these specific parameters.

These changes ensure that the `company` field is only considered mandatory when the user intends to use company-specific information. Otherwise, the application defaults to a generic approach for the cover letter, as intended. The client-side behavior of disabling the input when the checkbox is unchecked is compatible with this server-side logic.
