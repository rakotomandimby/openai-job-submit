# Option to not search about the target enterprise 

The user generally knows the target enterprise.
But when the job advertisement is made by a headhunter, the user may not know the target enterprise.
Therefore, the user should be able to choose if he wants to search about the target enterprise or not.

This is currently partially implemented in the code.
I want to add more user friendly option: when the user selects the option not to search about the target enterprise in the user interface, the input field for the target enterprise should be disabled so that the user cannot enter anything in it.

But if the user selects the option to search about the target enterprise, the input field for the target enterprise should be enabled and the user interface must remind the user that he must enter the target enterprise.

Propose me the changes to make to the user interface in order to achieve all that.
