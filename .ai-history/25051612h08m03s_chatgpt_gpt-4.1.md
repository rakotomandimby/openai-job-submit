# The CV redering has too much interline spacing

The cover letter rendering in the application is Good.

But the CV rendering has too much interline spacing. 
After checking the HTML fragment returned by the API, I found that the code is good, without extra new lines.

I suspect that the problem is somewhere in the code where the code applies a non visible blank line for each line in the HTML fragment.
Analyzing the code and tell me if I am in the right direction.

You are **absolutely on the right track** with your analysis.  
Let’s break down what’s happening:

---

## 1. **How the CV is Rendered**

- In your EJS template (`index.ejs`), the CV results are rendered as:
  ```ejs
  <div class="card-body" id="geminiCVResult" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
    <%- geminiCVResult %>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body" id="openAICVResult" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
    <%- openAICVResult %>
  </div>
  ```
  - `white-space: pre-wrap;` preserves newlines and spaces in the output.

---

## 2. **How the CV is Generated**

- In `ask-gemini.ts` and `ask-openai.ts`, the CV result is returned **as-is** (no `nl2br`):
  ```ts
  return text; // Gemini
  return nullToEmptyString(chatCompletion.choices[0].message.content); // OpenAI
  ```
- The **cover letter** result, however, is passed through `nl2br`, which converts newlines to `<br>` tags.

---

## 3. **What’s the Problem?**

- **If the CV is already HTML** (as instructed in your system prompt), and you render it with `white-space: pre-wrap;`, then:
  - Any newlines in the HTML fragment will be rendered as extra vertical space.
  - If the HTML fragment uses `<p>`, `<ul>`, etc., and you also preserve whitespace, you get **double spacing**.

- **If you were to use `nl2br` on the CV**, it would add `<br>` tags, which would also add extra lines if the HTML already has block elements.

---

## 4. **Why is the Cover Letter Fine?**

- The cover letter is **plain text** (not HTML), and you convert newlines to `<br>`, so it displays as expected.

---

## 5. **How to Fix the CV Spacing?**

- **Remove `white-space: pre-wrap;`** from the CV result containers in your EJS template.
- Let the browser render the HTML fragment as normal HTML.

---

### **Corrected EJS for CV Results**

```ejs
<div class="card-body" id="geminiCVResult">
  <%- geminiCVResult %>
</div>
<div class="card-body" id="openAICVResult">
  <%- openAICVResult %>
</div>
```
- **No `white-space: pre-wrap;`** for CVs.

---

### **Keep `white-space: pre-wrap;` for Cover Letters**

- Since cover letters are plain text with `<br>`, you can keep `white-space: pre-wrap;` for them if you want, or just rely on `<br>`.

| Section         | Data Type | How to Render?                | CSS Needed?              |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| CV Result       | HTML      | `<%- ... %>`                  | **No** `white-space`     |
| Cover Letter    | Plain text + `<br>` | `<%- ... %>`          | Optional: `pre-wrap`     |

---

## **Conclusion**

- **You are correct:** The extra spacing is due to `white-space: pre-wrap;` on HTML content.
- **Solution:** Remove `white-space: pre-wrap;` from the CV result containers.
