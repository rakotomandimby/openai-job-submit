# Add a custom CV generation

The current codebase generates a cover letter for the submitted job advertisement.

I would like to add a custom CV generation feature that takes the job advertisement and the user's CV as input and generates a new CV tailored to the job advertisement.

The generated CV will be displayed in a card above the cover letter card.

I want this app to perform two prompts for the job advertisement: one for the CV and one for the cover letter.

Tell me the modifications to make to the codebase to achieve this.
