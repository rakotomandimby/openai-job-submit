# Make number of words for cover letter predefined 

The current code lets the user define the number of words for the cover letter.
But this has no sense to let the user make a free choice.

I want to define a fixed choice of 3 options: 100, 200, 300 words.
I want 3 radio buttons for that.
They must be displayed inline, side by side, with a border in order to ease the choice.

Tell me the modifications make to `index.ejs` to implement that.
