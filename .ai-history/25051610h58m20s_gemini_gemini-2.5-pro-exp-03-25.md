# Option to not search about the target enterprise 

The user generally knows the target enterprise.
But when the job advertisement is made by a headhunter, the user may not know the target enterprise.

Therefore, the user should be able to choose if he wants to search about the target enterprise or not.

Propose me the changes to make to the user interface and the harcoded prompts in order to handle this option.
